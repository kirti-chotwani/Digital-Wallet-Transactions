# Digital-Wallet-Transactions
This project explores digital wallet transaction data to extract valuable insights, detect patterns, and identify fraudulent activities. Using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to optimize financial decision-making and enhance transaction security.

## Key Analyses Conducted
1. Revenue Analysis – Understanding total earnings, fee structures, and revenue sources.
2. Merchant Analysis – Evaluating merchant performance and transaction behaviors.
3. Trend Analysis – Identifying patterns in transaction volume and user behavior.
4. Time Series Forecasting – Predicting future transaction trends using moving averages.
5. Fraud Detection – Detecting suspicious transactions using IQR, Z-score, and Isolation Forest.

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels)
- Machine Learning (Isolation Forest for anomaly detection)
- Time Series Analysis (Moving averages, decomposition)
- Data Visualization (Heatmaps, line charts, bar graphs)

## Insights & Business Impact
- Revenue insights help optimize pricing strategies.
